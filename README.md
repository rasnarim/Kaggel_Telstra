# Kaggel_Telstra
## visualization tool
### Objectives
    - Demonstrate how to use pandas to vectorize data
    - Provide simple tool to visualize the vectorized data
    - NOTE: 
            This tool does not provide any solution regarding the problem on Kaggle. 
            Vectorized data can be further analyzed using sklearn or other machine learning packages. 
            It is suggested to do further feature engineering. 
### Testing
    - test_utils.py provides basic tests for FeatureVecBuilder - test data can be found in /test_data

### Requirements 
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
